**CNN_for_AtlasSurvey**

This is a repository that contains my work for developing a cnn that can identify objects out of the Atlas Sky Survey images.

The BasicDataAnalysis notebook just contains reference info about the data

FeedForwardModel is a simple neural network with fully cconnected layers, just to get used to how NNs work

CNNModel is my first attempt at making a CNN, hopefully will imrpove!
